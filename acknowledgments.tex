\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to acknowledge the following people and institutions who have, both directly and indirectly, been a part of my college journey and contributed to the completion of this work:

To my VIP family, for their continued support during parallel seminars and progress reports, and their company during the lunch/pakain/ma\~{n}anitas that come with it;

To my unofficial Art Team-mates---\textbf{Rene}, \textbf{Jayson}, and \textbf{Jem}---for the mutual acceptance and trust, lunch/dinners at UPTC (at the beginning of the month) and Daang Tubo (at the end of the month), the comfortable silence when working at the lab during weekends/holidays/late nights, and the Friday night adventures in Cubao;

To my sole CSI Team-mate, \textbf{Ate Ritz}, for the mentorship, discussions on compressive sensing, and for entrusting me with your research data;

To my inner VIP circle---those hitherto mentioned, plus \textbf{Ate Elexis} and \textbf{Imang}, for the dinners and Maginhawa adventures we have after each hell week (which sometimes turn into Cubao adventures as well);

To my batchmates---\textbf{Rene}, \textbf{Yego}, \textbf{LJ}, and \textbf{Andy}---for the times we could still jam and play Coup on a daily basis before we all got caught up in collective thesis anxiety, for our sleepovers at Yego's with the intention of reviewing for 151, but ended up doing other things 75\% of the time;

To \textbf{UP Iris}, for instilling in me the elements and principles of photography as an art form, and to those I consider my closest friends---\textbf{Eunnah}, \textbf{Popoy}, \textbf{Tupe}, \textbf{Qeren}, \textbf{Nicole}, and \textbf{Ella}---for our mutual respect for each other's art style, our common drive to keep improving as photographers, and our desire to uplift our org's best interests;

To \textbf{Fritz}---my best friend since second year high school---for the all-nighters and heart-to-heart talks at random coffee shops along Katipunan, gaining insights into each other's theses, and for the formidable friendship;

To \textbf{Jena}, for the continuous support;

To the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration--Education for Development Scholarship Program (OWWA-EDSP), for financially getting me through the grueling five years of quality UP education;

To \textbf{Ma'am Jing}, who was not only a thesis adviser to me, but also a mentor in topics not necessarily relating to physics, a mother figure, and a watchful guardian; for the tremendous patience, overflowing passion for teaching and costume parties, unmatched time-management skills, for showing what it's like to be a Siyentista ng Bayan, for all the little bits of wisdom and life hacks I picked up along the way; I will always be grateful, it has been a great honor being your advisee;

To \textbf{Tita Bebe}, my aunt and second mother for over a decade, who has made sure that I got everything I needed since sixth grade, as well as for a short time during my childhood;

And last but definitely not the least, to my mama \textbf{Tillie}, papa \textbf{Jaime}, and \textbf{Kiara}, who---despite us having been separated by years and by thousands of kilometers---have always made their full support felt, whether it be mental, financial, or material needs; this is dedicated to all of you.
