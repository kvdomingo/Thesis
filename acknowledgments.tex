I would like to express my gratitude to my thesis adviser, \textbf{Dr Maricor Soriano}, who guided me throughout my 2.5 years of research at the Instrumentation Physics Laboratory. I would also like to thank my family and friends who supported me, and kept me grounded and sane.

I wish to acknowledge the technical support provided by the \textbf{Philippine Coral Reef and Mangrove Remote Sensing Project} (PhilCoMaRS), and the financial support by the \textbf{Overseas Workers' Welfare Administation--Education for Development Scholarship Program} (OWWA-EDSP).
